CIS565: Project 5: WebGL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fall 2014

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Part 1, you are given code for:

* Drawing a VBO through WebGL
* Javascript code for interfacing with WebGL
* Functions for generating simplex noise

You are required to implement the following:

* A sin-wave based vertex shader:

![part1](resources/sinwave.png)

* One interesting vertex shader of your choice

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PART 2 REQUIREMENTS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Part 2, given code:

* Reading and loading textures
* Rendering a sphere with textures mapped on
* Basic passthrough fragment and vertex shaders 
* A basic globe with Earth terrain color mapping
* Gamma correcting textures
* javascript to interact with the mouse
  * left-click and drag moves the camera around
  * right-click and drag moves the camera in and out

Features implemented:

* Bump mapped terrain
* Rim lighting to simulate atmosphere
* Night-time lights on the dark side of the globe
* Specular mapping
* Moving clouds

You are also required to pick one open-ended effect to implement:

* Procedural water rendering and animation using noise 
* Draw a skybox around the entire scene for the stars.
* Dawn and twillight color blending

GH-PAGES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since this assignment is in WebGL you will make your project easily viewable by 
taking advantage of GitHub's project pages feature.

Once you are done you will need to create a new branch named gh-pages:

`git branch gh-pages`

Switch to your new branch:

`git checkout gh-pages`

Create an index.html file that is either your renamed frag_globe.html or 
contains a link to it, commit, and then push as usual. Now you can go to 

`<user_name>.github.io/<project_name>` 

to see your beautiful globe from anywhere.

README
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All students must replace or augment the contents of this Readme.md in a clear 
manner with the following:

* A brief description of the project and the specific features you implemented.
* At least one screenshot of your project running.
* A 30 second or longer video of your project running.  To create the video you
  can use http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/Encoder4_Overview.aspx 
* A performance evaluation (described in detail below).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The performance evaluation is where you will investigate how to make your 
program more efficient using the skills you've learned in class. You must have
performed at least one experiment on your code to investigate the positive or
negative effects on performance. 

We encourage you to get creative with your tweaks. Consider places in your code
that could be considered bottlenecks and try to improve them. 

Each student should provide no more than a one page summary of their
optimizations along with tables and or graphs to visually explain any
performance differences.

In this homework, we do not expect crazy performance evaluation in terms of
optimizations.  However, it would be good to take performance benchmarks at
every step in this assignment to see how complicated fragment shaders affect the
overall speed.  You can do this by using stats.js.

SUBMISSION
---
As with the previous project, you should fork this project and work inside of
your fork. Upon completion, commit your finished project back to your fork, and
make a pull request to the master repository.  You should include a README.md
file in the root directory detailing the following

* A brief description of the project and specific features you implemented
* At least one screenshot of your project running.
* A link to a video of your project running.
* Instructions for building and running your project if they differ from the
  base code.
* A performance writeup as detailed above.
* A list of all third-party code used.
* This Readme file edited as described above in the README section.
